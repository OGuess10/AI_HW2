## Implementation

### Overall Program

<p> We created classes for nodes, a minimum queue and trees for our implementation. Each node has many fields indicating its state, including the vacuum and dirt locations, the current cost, possible actions, parent node, depth, and children. The state information for the vacuum and dirty squares are simply kept as ordered pairs as a list type.</p>
<p> The function new_rooms_node is really important to making a new node. It determines the possible actions the vacuum can take from the given state. </p> <br>

### Iterative Deepening Tree Search

<p> This search algorithm has three different functions associated with it - the main function, iterative_deepening_tree_search, and two helper functions, idts_expand and idts_sol.   </p><br>

## Programming Language, Hardware

Language: Python v3.9 <br>
<p> Both instances of Iterative Deepening Tree Search were run on a Dell laptop with an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-9750H CPU @ 2.60GHz </p>
